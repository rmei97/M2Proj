# Modeling PC Video Games

In this project I model PC Video Games by getting data from a Kaggle Dataset which scraped data from VGChartz and Metacritic. Prior to this I attemped to create my own dataset using a Gamespot API and my own VGChartz webscrapper

In this repo:

home directory:
- kaggle_data.ipynb: cleans data which produced a csv file with only not null entries of PC plateform games.
- scrapper_vgchartz.ipynb: code for webscraping for vgzcharts website.

deliverable directory:
-  model_book: final notebook containing all code for graphs, transformations, statistical tests, and modeling pertaining to ppt
